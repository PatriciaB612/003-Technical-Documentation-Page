        <p>Visual Studio Code is an editor first and foremost, and includes the features you need for highly productive source code editing. This topic takes you through the basics of the editor and helps you get moving with your code.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Keyboard_shortcuts">
        <header>Keyboard shortcuts</header>
        <p>Being able to keep your hands on the keyboard when writing code is crucial for high productivity. VS Code has a rich set of default keyboard shortcuts as well as allowing you to customize them.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_keyboard-shortcuts-reference">Shortcuts Reference</a> - Learn the most commonly used and popular keyboard shortcuts by downloading the reference sheet.</li>
          <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_keymap-extensions">Install a Keymap extension</a> - Use the keyboard shortcuts of your old editor (such as Sublime Text, Atom, and Vim) in VS Code by installing a Keymap extension.</li>
          <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_keyboard-shortcuts-editor">Customize Keyboard Shortcuts</a> - Change the default keyboard shortcuts to fit your style.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Multiple_selections">
        <header>Multiple selections</header>
        <p>VS Code supports multiple cursors for fast simultaneous edits. You can add secondary cursors (rendered thinner) with Alt+Click. Each cursor operates independently based on the context it sits in. A common way to add more cursors is with Ctrl+Alt+Down or Ctrl+Alt+Up that insert cursors below or above.</p>
        <p>Ctrl+D selects the word at the cursor, or the next occurrence of the current selection.</p>
        <h3>Multi-cursor modifier</h3> 
        <p>If you'd like to change the modifier key for applying multiple cursors to Cmd+Click on macOS and Ctrl+Click on Windows and Linux, you can do so with the editor.multiCursorModifier setting. This lets users coming from other editors such as Sublime Text or Atom continue to use the keyboard modifier they are familiar with.</p>
        <p>The setting can be set to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ctrlCmd - Maps to Ctrl on Windows and Cmd on macOS.</li>
          <li>alt - The existing default Alt.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There's also a menu item Use Ctrl+Click for Multi-Cursor in the Selection menu to quickly toggle this setting.</p>
        <p>The Go to Definition and Open Link gestures will also respect this setting and adapt such that they do not conflict. For example, when the setting is ctrlCmd, multiple cursors can be added with Ctrl/Cmd+Click, and opening links or going to definition can be invoked with Alt+Click.</p>
        <h3>Shrink/expand selection</h3>
        <p>Quickly shrink or expand the current selection. Trigger it with Shift+Alt+Left and Shift+Alt+Right.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Column_(box)_selection">
        <header>Column (box) selection</header>
        <p>Place the cursor in one corner and then hold Shift+Alt while dragging to the opposite corner.</p>
        <p>Note: This changes to Shift+Ctrl/Cmd when using Ctrl/Cmd as multi-cursor modifier.</p>
        <h3>Column Selection mode</h3>
        <p>The user setting Editor: Column Selection controls this feature. Once this mode is entered, as indicated in the Status bar, the mouse gestures and the arrow keys will create a column selection by default. This global toggle is also accessible via the Selection > Column Selection Mode menu item. In addition, one can also disable Column Selection mode from the Status bar.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Save_/_Auto_Save">
        <header>Save / Auto Save</header>
        <p>By default, VS Code requires an explicit action to save your changes to disk, Ctrl+S.</p>
        <p>However, it's easy to turn on Auto Save, which will save your changes after a configured delay or when focus leaves the editor. With this option turned on, there is no need to explicitly save the file. The easiest way to turn on Auto Save is with the File > Auto Save toggle that turns on and off save after a delay.</p>
        <p>For more control over Auto Save, open User or Workspace settings and find the associated settings:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>files.autoSave: Can have the values:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>off - to disable auto save.</li>
              <li>afterDelay - to save files after a configured delay (default 1000 ms).</li>
              <li>onFocusChange - to save files when focus moves out of the editor of the dirty file.</li>
              <li>onWindowChange - to save files when the focus moves out of the VS Code window.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>files.autoSaveDelay: Configures the delay in milliseconds when files.autoSave is configured to afterDelay. The default is 1000 ms.</li>
        </ul>
      
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Search_Editor">
        <header>Search Editor</header>
        <p>Search Editors let you view workspace search results in a full-sized editor, complete with syntax highlighting and optional lines of surrounding context.</p>
        <p>The Open Search Editor command opens an existing Search Editor if one exists, or to otherwise create a new one. The New Search Editor command will always create a new Search Editor.</p>
        <p>In the Search Editor, results can be navigated to using Go to Definition actions, such as F12 to open the source location in the current editor group, or Ctrl+K F12 to open the location in an editor to the side. Additionally, double-clicking can optionally open the source location, configurable with the search.searchEditor.doubleClickBehaviour setting.</p>
        <h3>Search Editor commands and arguments</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>search.action.openNewEditor - Opens the Search Editor in a new tab.</li>
          <li>search.action.openInEditor - Copy the current Search results into a new Search Editor.</li>
          <li>search.action.openNewEditorToSide - Opens the Search Editor in a new window next to the window you currently have opened.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are two arguments that you can pass to the Search Editor commands (search.action.openNewEditor, search.action.openNewEditorToSide) to allow keybindings to configure how a new Search Editor should behave:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>There are two arguments that you can pass to the Search Editor commands (search.action.openNewEditor, search.action.openNewEditorToSide) to allow keybindings to configure how a new Search Editor should behave:</li>
          <li>focusResults - Whether to put focus in the results of a search or the query input. Default is true.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, the following keybinding runs the search when the Search Editor is opened but leaves the focus in the search query control.</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            {
    "key": "ctrl+o",
    "command": "search.action.openNewEditor",
    "args": { "query": "VS Code", "triggerSearch": true, "focusResults": false }
  }
          </code>
        </pre>
        <h3>Search Editor context default</h3>
        <p>The search.searchEditor.defaultNumberOfContextLines setting has a default value of 1, meaning one context line will be shown before and after each result line in the Search Editor.</p>
        <h3>Reuse last Search Editor configuration</h3>
        <p>The search.searchEditor.reusePriorSearchConfiguration setting (default is false) lets you reuse the last active Search Editor's configuration when creating a new Search Editor.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="IntelliSense">
        <header>IntelliSense</header>
        <p>We'll always offer word completion, but for the rich languages, such as JavaScript, JSON, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Less, C# and TypeScript, we offer a true IntelliSense experience. If a language service knows possible completions, the IntelliSense suggestions will pop up as you type. You can always manually trigger it with Ctrl+Space. By default, Tab or Enter are the accept keyboard triggers but you can also customize these key bindings.</p>
        <p>JavaScript and TypeScript developers can take advantage of the npmjs type declaration (typings) file repository to get IntelliSense for common JavaScript libraries (Node.js, React, Angular). You can find a good explanation on using type declaration files in the JavaScript language topic and the Node.js tutorial.</p>
        <p>Learn more in the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense">IntelliSense document.</a></p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Formatting">
        <header>Formatting</header>
        <p>VS Code has great support for source code formatting. The editor has two explicit format actions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Format Document (Shift+Alt+F) - Format the entire active file.</li>
          <li>Format Selection (Ctrl+K Ctrl+F) - Format the selected text.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can invoke these from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) or the editor context menu.</p>
        <p>VS Code has default formatters for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, and HTML. Each language has specific formatting options (for example, html.format.indentInnerHtml) which you can tune to your preference in your user or workspace settings. You can also disable the default language formatter if you have another extension installed that provides formatting for the same language.</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            "html.format.enable": false
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>Along with manually invoking code formatting, you can also trigger formatting based on user gestures such as typing, saving or pasting. These are off by default but you can enable these behaviors through the following settings:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>editor.formatOnType - Format the line after typing.</li>
          <li>editor.formatOnSave - Format a file on save.</li>
          <li>editor.formatOnPaste - Format the pasted content.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to the default formatters, you can find extensions on the Marketplace to support other languages or formatting tools. There is a Formatters category so you can easily search and find formatting extensions. In the Extensions view search box, type 'formatters' or 'category:formatters' to see a filtered list of extensions within VS Code.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Folding">
        <header>Folding</header>
        <p>You can fold regions of source code using the folding icons on the gutter between line numbers and line start. Move the mouse over the gutter and click to fold and unfold regions. Use Shift + Click on the folding icon to fold or unfold the region and all regions inside.</p>
        <p>You can also use the following actions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fold (Ctrl+Shift+[) folds the innermost uncollapsed region at the cursor.</li>
          <li>Unfold (Ctrl+Shift+]) unfolds the collapsed region at the cursor.</li>
          <li>Toggle Fold (Ctrl+K Ctrl+L) folds or unfolds the region at the cursor.</li>
          <li>Fold Recursively (Ctrl+K Ctrl+[) folds the innermost uncollapsed region at the cursor and all regions inside that region.</li>
          <li>Unfold Recursively (Ctrl+K Ctrl+]) unfolds the region at the cursor and all regions inside that region.</li>
          <li>Fold All (Ctrl+K Ctrl+0) folds all regions in the editor.</li>
          <li>Unfold All (Ctrl+K Ctrl+J) unfolds all regions in the editor.</li>
          <li>Fold Level X (Ctrl+K Ctrl+2 for level 2) folds all regions of level X, except the region at the current cursor position.</li>
          <li>Fold All Block Comments (Ctrl+K Ctrl+/) folds all regions that start with a block comment token.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Folding regions are by default evaluated based on the indentation of lines. A folding region starts when a line has a smaller indent than one or more following lines, and ends when there is a line with the same or smaller indent.</p>
        <p>Folding regions can also be computed based on syntax tokens of the editor's configured language. The following languages already provide syntax aware folding: Markdown, HTML, CSS, LESS, SCSS, and JSON.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Indentation">
        <header>Indentation</header>
        <p>VS Code lets you control text indentation and whether you'd like to use spaces or tab stops. By default, VS Code inserts spaces and uses 4 spaces per Tab key. If you'd like to use another default, you can modify the editor.insertSpaces and editor.tabSize settings.</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            "editor.insertSpaces": true,
            "editor.tabSize": 4,

      <section class="main-section" id="Common_questions">
        <header>Common Questions</header>
        <h3>Is it possible to globally search and replace?</h3>
        <p>Yes, expand the Search view text box to include a replace text field. You can search and replace across all the files in your workspace. Note that if you did not open VS Code on a folder, the search will only run on the currently open files.</p>
        <h3>How do I turn on word wrap?</h3>
        <p>You can control word wrap through the editor.wordWrap setting. By default, editor.wordWrap is off but if you set to it to on, text will wrap on the editor's viewport width.</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            "editor.wordWrap": "on"
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>You can toggle word wrap for the VS Code session with Alt+Z.</p>
        <p>You can also add vertical column rulers to the editor with the editor.rulers setting, which takes an array of column character positions where you'd like vertical rulers.</p>
        <h3>How can I avoid placing extra cursors in word wrapped lines?</h3>
        <p>If you'd like to ignore line wraps when adding cursors above or below your current selection, you can pass in { "logicalLine": true } to args on the keybinding like this:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            {
              "key": "shift+alt+down",
              "command": "editor.action.insertCursorBelow",
              "when": "textInputFocus",
              "args": { "logicalLine": true },
            },
            {
              "key": "shift+alt+up",
              "command": "editor.action.insertCursorAbove",
              "when": "textInputFocus",
              "args": { "logicalLine": true },
            },
